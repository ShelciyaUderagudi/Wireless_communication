# Wireless Channel Throughput Simulation

This project simulates 1000 random wireless channel conditions using a Gaussian-distributed SNR model. 
For each channel realization, Shannon capacity is computed, and the average throughput is reported.

## Features
- Random SNR generation (Gaussian shadowing)
- dB-to-linear conversion
- Shannon capacity calculation
- Throughput distribution histogram

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
